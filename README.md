## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

# ðŸ‘‹ About Me

I am a postgraduate student at [Beihang University](https://www.buaa.edu.cn/), advised by Prof. Rui Zhong, Prof. Yinghong Jia, and Prof. Haichao Gui. Before that, I received my B.S. degree majoring in Robotics Engineering at [Harbin Institute of Technology](https://www.hit.edu.cn/).

My research focuses on **robot learning** -- to enable machines to intelligently interact with the world, improve themselves over time and acquire novel skills via machine learning.
